# Workarounds

Things in this repo that exist **only** because something upstream is broken or missing. Each entry says what to run to find out whether it is still needed, and what makes it removable. Nothing here is a design decision — deliberate choices belong in the module they live in, not on this list

Rules for this file: one entry per workaround, and every entry must carry a **mechanical** removal check (a command whose output decides it), never a date

## `wayland.windowManager.hyprland.systemd.enable = false`

**Where:** `home-manager/desktop/hyprland/hyprland.nix`

**Symptom it prevents:** logging into the `Hyprland (uwsm)` session shows the cursor on a black screen for ~2 seconds, then drops back to SDDM, forever. The plain `Hyprland` session entry is unaffected

**Why it happens:** HM's hyprland module appends `systemctl --user stop hyprland-session.target` to the `exec-once` it generates. That target declares:

```
BindsTo=graphical-session.target
PropagatesStopTo=graphical-session.target
```

uwsm's `wayland-session@.target` in turn declares `BindsTo=graphical-session.target`, and the compositor unit `wayland-wm@hyprland.desktop.service` declares `BindsTo=wayland-session@%i.target`. So the stop cascades all the way into the compositor. In the journal this looks like a **clean stop job** — `Stopped Main service for Hyprland` plus `Triggering OnSuccess=`, no `Main process exited`, and the Hyprland log in `/run/user/1000/hypr/<sig>/hyprland.log` just ends mid-render with no backtrace. Easy to misread as a GPU or driver fault; it is neither. Plain Hyprland survives because there the compositor is a bare process, not a systemd unit, so nothing is bound to the target

**Why turning it off is free:** Hyprland does the same work natively — it links `libsystemd` and on startup runs

```
systemctl --user import-environment DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME PATH XDG_DATA_DIRS
  && dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE …
```

and sends `sd_notify(READY=1)` unless `HYPRLAND_NO_SD_NOTIFY` is set. That is exactly what uwsm needs: its `waitenv` waits for `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` + `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`, and the `Type=notify` compositor unit needs the readiness signal. So **no `uwsm finalize` line in `exec-once` is needed** — an earlier attempt added one, it was a duplicate, it was removed

**Rejected alternative:** `systemd.extraCommands = [ ]` disables only the destructive half and keeps HM's env export. It works, but leaves a `hyprland-session.target` nothing ever starts, an `exec-shutdown` that stops it, and a second copy of an export Hyprland already does

**Removal check:**

```sh
# the conflict stands as long as HM's module has no idea uwsm exists
grep -ric uwsm "$(nix eval --raw '.#nixosConfigurations.nixos-pc.config.home-manager.extraSpecialArgs.inputs.home-manager.outPath' 2>/dev/null)/modules/services/window-managers/hyprland/"
```

Zero hits → keep the line. Once it is non-zero, read what HM does now, then drop the option and test a real `Hyprland (uwsm)` login. If that login loops again:

```sh
journalctl -b 0 | grep uwsm_waitenv   # shows which variable never arrived
```

Note Hyprland's own flake does not change any of this: its `homeManagerModules.default` only sets `package` and defers to HM's module for everything else

**Upstream:** [NixOS UWSM wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/UWSM) (says to disable the integration), [hyprwm/Hyprland#9265](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/9265)

## `overlay-hyprland` — glaze pinned to 7.2.0

**Where:** `flake.nix`

**Why:** nixpkgs carries `glaze` 8.0.0, which hyprland 0.56.1 does not build against, so the overlay pins hyprland's `glaze` **back** to 7.2.0 from GitHub. Note this is a downgrade — a newer nixpkgs `glaze` is therefore not by itself evidence the overlay can go

**Removal check:** build hyprland as nixpkgs has it, with no overlay in the way

```sh
nix build --no-link --impure --expr \
  'let f = builtins.getFlake (toString ./.); in f.inputs.nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.hyprland'
```

Builds clean → drop `overlay-hyprland` from `flake.nix` and from the `nixos-pc` overlay list. Still fails on `glaze` → keep it, and bump the pinned tag only if hyprland itself moved on
